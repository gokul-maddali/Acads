Clustering of images for classification (Rapid Miner, Matlab and C++)
 Classification scheme was based on a combination of Decision Trees and k-Means clustering
 RapidMiner’s toolboxes on supervised and unsupervised learning were used for building the model.


Implemented Fibonacci heap and used it to implement Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.
  Compared performance of Fibonacci Heap based Prim’s algorithm to that of Array based Prim’s algorithm for sparse and dense graphs.
  
  Replicated Reducer functionality of combining Key, Value pairs and returning the sorted and aggregated pairs in a parallel processing environment
  Used MPI for the parallel processing and bulk communication amongst the processors.
